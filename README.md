**1.** Erekir ore placements are quite complicated, it's not as "regular" as Serpulo, which could be easily scaled to any amount of resources, I have tried a few placements but it's all not quite right and often "screw things up", since Erekir maps are mostly "packed" and require faster strategies and reactions, adding new resources to it seems to disrupt that and hinder you instead, even though making high-end resources such as carbide directly mineable seems tempting, but in reality, it's all more of a hindrance than a help, I don't know though, maybe I could find a perfect parameter in the future to place the ores, who knows?

**2.** By default, all ores are activated except Dormant Cyst, which is absolutely useless at the moment, but you could still activate it if you want.
